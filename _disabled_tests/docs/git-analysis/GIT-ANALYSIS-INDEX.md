## Analysis Methodology

This analysis was generated using the following approach:

### Data Collection
1. `git log --oneline -30` - Retrieved last 30 commits
2. `git log --pretty=format` - Extracted detailed commit information
3. `git log --grep` - Categorized by type (feat, fix, docs, test, etc.)
4. `git log --date=short` - Extracted commit dates for timeline

### Analysis Phases
1. **Raw Data Extraction** - Parsed commit messages and metadata
2. **Categorization** - Organized by type, component, severity
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Identified themes and trends
4. **Context Integration** - Combined with CLAUDE.md project knowledge
5. **Synthesis** - Created four complementary views
6. **Validation** - Cross-referenced details across documents

### Quality Assurance
- All commit hashes verified against git log
- All commit messages quoted exactly
- Dates validated against git metadata
- Component classifications verified against code structure
- Performance metrics cross-referenced with CLAUDE.md documentation
