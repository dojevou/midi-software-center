## 🎯 Instrument Detection Priority

For MPC organization, instruments are detected in this order:

1. **GM Program Number** (if available from MIDI)
2. **Filename Analysis** (bass, piano, synth, etc.)
3. **Filepath Analysis** (folder names: drums, keys, etc.)
4. **Musical Analysis** (is_percussive, has_chords, has_melody)
5. **Polyphony Analysis** (monophonic vs polyphonic)

---

## 📊 Collection Statistics (From Your 142,080 Files)

**Note:** These stats will be populated after Phase 4 (Analysis) completes:

- Total files: 142,080 ✅
- Files analyzed: 0 (pending)
- Drum files: TBD
- Bass files: TBD
- Keys files: TBD
- Leads files: TBD
- Other files: TBD

**To update stats after analysis:**
```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN is_percussive = true THEN 'DRUMS'
    WHEN has_melody = true AND is_monophonic = true THEN 'BASS/LEADS'
    WHEN has_chords = true THEN 'KEYS'
    ELSE 'OTHER'
  END as category,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM musical_metadata
GROUP BY category;
```

## 🔧 Usage in Pipeline

This instrument list is used in:

1. **Phase 2 (Sanitize):** `normalize_filenames.rs`
2. **Phase 4 (Analysis):** `analyze.rs` + `drum_analyzer.rs`
3. **Phase 5 (Rename):** `mpc_backup.rs`

All three phases reference this documentation for consistent instrument detection and categorization.
