Since historical patterns are empty, I'll draw from common pitfalls in similar Rust/Tauri/MIDI projects (e.g., dependency mismatches, cross-thread MIDI handling, and frontend-backend sync issues) to inform recommendations. The analysis emphasizes the current failed build state, the predicted dependency misconfigurations, MIDI reliability, and long-term maintainability. Insights are prioritized by immediacy: fix current issues first, then prevent future risks.\n\n#### 1. Current State Analysis: Addressing the Build Failure and Immediate Risks\nThe build status indicates a single error preventing success, likely tied to the predicted dependency issues in `pipeline/src-tauri/Cargo.tom..."
