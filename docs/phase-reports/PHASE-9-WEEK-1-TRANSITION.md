## 11. Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Deployment Takes Longer Than Expected
**Likelihood:** LOW (15%)
**Impact:** MEDIUM (delays Week 1 testing work)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Extended timeline allocated (6-8 hours vs. 4 hours)
- Deployment team on standby with backup resources
- Rollback procedure ready and tested in staging
- Canary deployment approach (10% → 50% → 100%)
- Clear Go/No-Go decision points every 2 hours

**Contingency Plan:**
- If deployment exceeds 8 hours, pause and reschedule
- Use rollback procedure to restore previous version
- Conduct root cause analysis before retry
- Adjust Days 3-5 timeline if needed

---

### Risk 2: Error Fix Creates Regression
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (30%)
**Impact:** HIGH (breaks production tests)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Each fix tested independently before commit
- Comprehensive test suite run after each fix
- Code review required for all changes
- Staging environment validation before merge
- Git commit strategy allows easy revert

**Contingency Plan:**
- Immediately revert problematic commit
- Test Engineer documents issue in tracker
- Tech Lead reviews fix pattern for correctness
- Re-implement fix with additional testing
- Consider pairing engineers for complex fixes

---

### Risk 3: Integration Tests Infrastructure Work Blocked
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM (25%)
**Impact:** LOW (can defer to Week 2)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Day 5 has Option A (infrastructure) and Option B (error fixes)
- Infrastructure work not on critical path for production
- Can be deferred to Week 2 Day 6+ without impact
- Clear decision criteria documented in WEEK-1-DAY-5-PLAN.md

**Contingency Plan:**
- If infrastructure work blocked, execute Option B (error fixes)
- Complete remaining 14 error handling issues
- Defer infrastructure work to Week 2
- Re-assess priority during Week 2 planning

---

### Risk 4: Production Issues Discovered During Testing
**Likelihood:** LOW (10%)
**Impact:** CRITICAL (blocks deployment)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Comprehensive pre-deployment validation completed
- Security audit cleared with zero critical issues
- Performance benchmarks all passing
- Database backup created and verified
- Rollback procedure ready for immediate execution

**Contingency Plan:**
- If P0/P1 issue discovered, halt deployment immediately
- Execute rollback procedure to restore stable state
- Conduct emergency bug fix session
- Re-run full validation suite
- Reschedule deployment for next available window

---

### Risk 5: Team Member Unavailable
**Likelihood:** LOW (10%)
**Impact:** MEDIUM (delays specific tasks)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Cross-training completed for all critical roles
- Documentation comprehensive enough for any engineer
- Backup engineer identified for each role
- Task granularity allows easy hand-off
- Tech Lead can cover any role if needed

**Contingency Plan:**
- Assign backup engineer to take over tasks
- Use QUICK-REFERENCE-CARD.md for rapid onboarding
- Adjust timeline if needed (most tasks have buffer)
- Communicate changes to team immediately
